# vehicle_routing_problem
We have used two variants of genetic algorithm to solve this problem.

Variant-1:
1. Use Fitness Proportionate Selection (FPS) method to select parent individuals
2. Use Order Crossover between parent individuals to create children
3. Use Inverse mutation
4. Use Elitism method to select survivor for next generation

Variant-2:
1. Use Stochastic Universal Sampling (SUS) method to select parent individuals
2. Use Partially mapped Crossover between parent individuals to create children
3. Use Swap mutation
4. Use Steady State Genetic Algo method to select survivor for next generation

We have used Dataset of Solomon.
